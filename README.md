# Robust Mean Estimation
Robust mean estimation is a statistical technique designed to compute a reliable mean in the presence of outliers and heavy-tailed inliers.
Two functions are provided:
1) `robust_mean` : this algorithm does not require the knowledge of fraction of outliers.
2) `meta_robust_mean` :  this algorithm does not require the knowledge of fraction of outliers, or the knowledge of spectral bound.
   
Implementation of algorithms from the following references:
